# Sage Data for NodeRED

This node simplifies getting Sage data into NodeRED so you can focus on the **_fun parts_** of your project!

The node can be configured with a standard query filter. For more general information about
data queries, see the [docs](https://docs.sagecontinuum.org/docs/tutorials/accessing-data).

## Usage

Since this is in early development, you should install this package directly from the repo in your NodeRED environment:

```sh
npm install https://github.com/seanshahkarami/node-red-contrib-sage-data
```
