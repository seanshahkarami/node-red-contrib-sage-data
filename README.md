# NodeRED Sage Data Node

This NodeRED simplifies the integration of Sage data into NodeRED flows by watching and
sending measurements from the Sage Data API.

The node can be configured with a standard query filter. For more general information about
data queries, see the [docs](https://docs.sagecontinuum.org/docs/tutorials/accessing-data).

## Usage

Since this is in early development, you should install this package directly from the repo in your NodeRED environment:

```sh
npm install https://github.com/seanshahkarami/node-red-contrib-sage-data
```
